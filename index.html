    <h2>The Challenge</h2>
    <p>Beginning <strong><em>June 1, 2022,</em></strong> for a minimum of one hour each day I will study JavaScript, with the aim of updating my 90s-born knowledge of JS (ask me about DHTML!) to having a confident competence in the language.</p>
    <p>I will post daily updates on <a href="https://twitter.com/cassius_zedaker?t=BZ0Te0sqCjhBQjcXHM90rA&s=09">Twitter</a> reaffirming my commitment to this project, as well as posting this page, and any relevant projects, to GitHub as a record of my progress.</p>

  <li><a href="https://github.com/DontMindU/100DaysofCode">GitHub Repository</a></li>

  <li><a href="js/consolelog.js">Console Log</a></li>
  <p>Set up my first ever GitHub, which is <em>huge!</em> Also created this basic page and committed it to GitHub, for tracking this challenge. Also, began the JavaScript refresher on <a href="http://www.sololearn.com">SoloLearn</a>, realized I already know most of the fundamentals, and even learned something! An auspicious beginning.</p>
  <h5>6/2/2022</h5>
  <li>Added <span id="w3jstest" onclick="document.getElementById('w3jstest').style.display='none'">w3.js,</span> a basic JS framework. But it doesn't seem to work! I've tested everything and it seems like the file isn't loading, but I don't know why. Going to forget it for now and go back to a tutorial.</li>
  <li>Refresher on program structures (if-then-else, and switch) on SoloLearn. Next up: loops, which have always given me headaches.</li>
  <li>Went to <a href="www.w3schools.com">W3Schools'</a> JS tutorial, and was immediately able to fix the above problem. Made the "w3.js" text above simply disappear when clicked.
  <p>The SoloLearn tutorial would be good for, say, DroidScript, where the W3Schools tutorial is much more useful for web developers, and I will make a note of that going forward.</p>
  <p>SoloLearn starts with <code>document.write()</code> and <code>console.log()</code>, whereas W3Schools starts with <code>document.getElementById()</code>. Good to know!</p></li>
  <li>Wishlisted <a href="droidscript.org">DroidScript</a>, an app for developing native Android apps in Javascript. Anyway, back to the tutorial.</li>
  <li>Javascript, at least as it relates to web design, is most closely tied to HTML forms. As one project that I need to finish is the Contact form for my homepage, that will be my major project for the first part of this challenge.</li>
  <p>Started two Javascript turorials, but what I'm learning is that JS is deeply tied to HTML and CSS, and I'm spending as much time looking up references on those as I am on JS itself.</p>
  <p>So JS remains the focus, but I still see a lot of time going into the other Front End technologies moving forward.</p>
