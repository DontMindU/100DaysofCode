# 100DaysofCode

My repository for 100 Days of Code challenge.
My knowledge of JS is 90s-born. Ask me about DHTML!
My first project is to create a functional contact page for my website, which is a full stack project involving minimal Javascript.
After that I will probably transition to DroidScript.
